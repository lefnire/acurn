  The chart below shows the hospitalâ€™s new acuity tool. Rating options are 1 through 4, with 1 indicating the lowest acuity and
  4 indicating the highest acuity. Ratings are based on nursing time needed to complete a task, emotional and physical energy
  expenditure required, expertise required, frequency of tasks and interventions, and follow-up assessments related to a specific
  task. Ratings for all five criteria categories are summed up to obtain a total acuity score for each patient, ranging from 1 to 60.
  Then the total acuity scores are clustered into acuity category scores, which range from 1 to 4, with 1 being the lowest acuity and
  4 being the highest
